summary: "I have extensive experience in teaching research methods. I was the instructor of record of Learning Analytics (EME 6551) at University of Florida. I also TAed for research methods in Human-Environment Relations (DEA 3550) at Cornell. I developed the curriculum and used my research in academia and industry as cases for students to practice."

## Content and Curriculum

RapidMiner, providing a flow-based graphic programming interface, was used to teach basic Machine Learning concepts. The whole course includes eight modules, using a real-world dataset that I collected from my dissertation (https://github.com/wdwdz/learningdashboard).

I recorded videos, give reading assignments, and moderate discussions to give students diverse online learning experience. The course schedule is attached below.
