Net Promoter Score (NPS) is extensively adopted by many products as a key indicator of consumers’ experiences and loyalty measured by a single question. One biggest challenge of this approach is the lack of ability to identify driving factors behind customers’ responses to the single question. The plausible way of using satisfaction survey to measure these factors is criticized for lacking direct causal relationship between consumers’ responses to NPS question and their perceived satisfaction. Also, most surveys are biased as they fail to capture the complexity of humans who can be both promoters and distractors.

In this case study of a food delivery app which has millions of daily active users, we designed and conducted a new survey to measure the impact of each driving factor to NPS and proposed actionable product and business strategies from the survey result. The survey structure was constructed based on interview results that summarized how most respondents would answer the reasons of giving their specific scores in a nature way. The survey content was adapted from an existed user satisfaction survey of this APP. In this survey, by collecting and analyzing respondents’ comprehensive attitudes and opinions, we lessened the problem of causal relationship and humans’ complexity when quantifying impact of NPS driving factors.

The result from this new survey (n = 3489) was discussed and limitations of the study was addressed. We propose this survey framework would be useful to quantify the impact of driving factors on NPS of products and universal in other contexts.
