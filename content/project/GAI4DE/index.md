Although promising, using image Generative AI (GAI) in design education is limited, partly due to a lack of appropriate applications that can facilitate students’ creativity process and instructors’ design critique. To address the gap, guided by the theories of the design creativity process, we designed, tested, and refined a creativity support tool (CST) (i.e., GAI4DE) with a design process feature. This tool has a generation feature powered by Stable Diffusion and a process feature that records users’ prompts and generated images to facilitate the creativity process and critique. To examine how the tool use is related to students’ perceived creativity support as well as students’ and instructors’ opinions on and suggestions for this tool, we conducted a one-week field study in a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) class (n = 60) with a workshop, home task, and a design critique session on interior and fashion design projects. We collected and analyzed student log data and perceived creativity support after the field study, as well as responses to open-ended questions to learn about instructors’ experience and suggestions for improving the feature. Students reported they sometimes used the process feature, and about 10% of the total generated images were adapted from images in the process feature. Students’ perceived collaboration, enjoyment, and exploration (sub-constructs of creativity support) were significantly and positively correlated with their self-reported use frequency. Instructors felt this feature brought opportunities to guide students’ design process. This study contributes to the research and practice of CST powered by GAI by developing and empirically studying, offering valuable insights for tool designers and educators, and laying the groundwork for future advancements in GAI tools in design education.
