Although image-generative AI (GAI) has sparked heated discussion among engineers and designers, its role in CAD (computer-aided design) education, particularly during the conceptual design phase, remains not sufficiently explored. To address this, we examined the integration of GAI into the early stages of design in a CAD class. Specifically, we conducted an in-class workshop introducing the Midjourney tool for conceptual design and released a home assignment on mood board design for hands-on GAI design practice. Twenty students completed the workshop and submitted the assignment from a CAD class in a human-centered design department at a research-intensive university. We collected and analyzed data from surveys, students’ prompts with Midjourney, and design artifacts to gain insights into their perceptions of GAI, behaviors of using GAI, and creativity after using GAI. We also conducted a correlation analysis between perceptions, prompt behaviors, and design creativity. After the workshop, students significantly rated the GAI as more useful and user-friendly in design and found it more supportive in terms of design efficiency and aesthetics, while we did not find a significant difference in their artifacts’  creativity. By analyzing 365 prompts used for completing home tasks, we identified three types of prompt behaviors: generation, modification, and selection, as well as classified three types of workflows: exploration, two-step, and multi-step. The correlation analysis showed that design creativity change was significantly and positively correlated with their prompt behaviors where students who have more multi-step prompts produced more creative artifacts based on the instructors’ evaluation. This exploratory study offered valuable insights for the integration of GAI in CAD education and suggested potential directions for future image-generative AI curricula and tools for teaching design.
