The gap in Post-occupancy Evaluation (POE) between place design, adaptation and occupants’ voices often stems from inadequate data collection from occupants and challenges in analyzing place data by practitioners. Through AI and Generative AI, new avenues have opened to rapidly evaluate and adapt physical working and learning environments to better meet occupants' needs. FECE-AI seeks to address this gap by establishing a sustainable community-aimed tool for collecting and analyzing feedback in real-time and capturing suggestions from occupants regarding their working and learning environments powered by AI technologies, enabling practitioners such as designers and facility managers to make informed decisions to finetune the design and/or space management. \
The FECE-AI project will construct a collaborative team from both academia and design industry (Figure 1). The team aims to create a sustainable POE community that applies Generative AI to facilitate the creation of environment evaluations from occupants and derive actionable design strategies using multimodal technologies for practitioners. To achieve this, the team will design and host various activities to boost the engagement of occupants and practitioners within this POE community. In addition, the team will iteratively design and develop POE technologies employing an agile and design-based research framework. Subsequently, we will implement two studies on a university campus to meet the diverse needs of occupants and stakeholders, promoting the sustainable adaptation of space design through AI-powered solutions. The project’s success will be measured through diverse outcomes by an independent facility manager, aiming to generate significant impacts in both academia and industry.
