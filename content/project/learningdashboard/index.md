Zhu, W., Li, C., Zhu, G., Li, Y, Xing, W, Shao, K. (2024). ISEA: Instructor-in-the-loop Student Engagement Analytics via FAccT AI Clustering. In Proceedings of the International Conference of the Learning Sciences-ICLS 2024, pp. 1598-1601. Buffalo, New York, United States. 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have become increasingly popular to analyze student engagement in online environments over the last decade; however, these approaches are still not widely adopted in practice by instructors, partly due to AI’s black box problem. Engagement analytics may fail to analyze the complexity of engagement construct in theory; and instructors may lack trust and control in techniques. To tackle these issues, we designed and developed the iSEA toolkit for engagement analytics that 1. involves instructors in the analytics design, 2. visualizes analytics process, and 3. applies fair AI algorithm for adjusting analytic results. We then conducted interviews with six instructors who had various online teaching experiences to understand their concerns with applying AI in engagement analytics and their experience on using iSEA. Participants showed diverse ways to analyze student engagement via iSEA and expressed how it improved their trust in engagement analytics. The results showcased an effective way to integrate instructors’ opinions, learning theory, and AI techniques together toward applying AI in real-world settings when analytics are more transparent.
