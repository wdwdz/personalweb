Background
Traditional math education often emphasizes procedural fluency over a deep
understanding of mathematical concepts, focusing on obtaining the “right” answer
rather than exploring underlying principles or fostering engagement. Generative AI has
a promise for enhancing student-driven exploration, deep understanding of math
concepts and engagement.
Aim
This study proposes a pedagogy: Reading-Solving-Creating and a platform that
enables students to create math stories, enhancing their conceptual understanding of
key mathematical ideas. We explored the effectiveness of integrating AI into
math education regarding this pedagogy and technology.
Samples
The pedagogy and platform were implemented in two K5 schools, one in California, the
other in Florida, with 69 students to evaluate its effectiveness.
Methods
Mixed methods: A pretest-intervention-post-design assessed the project’s
effectiveness on student math learning skills, outcomes and experience towards mathematics. The study introduced two modules on fraction multiplication and division,
recognized as challenging topics in elementary math. The sessions spanning 3 to 5
lessons of 30 to 45 minutes each, involved tool navigation, problem solving, and
creating new problems with AI support. Following the intervention, interviews and two
focus group discussions were held exploring their experiences and feedback on the
program to enhance its effectiveness.
Results
We found both student cohorts in California and Florida reported significant increases
in their math problem as well as non-word problem (fraction multiplication and division)
scores. In the interview, all the students expressed their liking for this
project, for instance.
Conclusions
The results suggest that AI-powered math story creation can be an effective pedagogy
and tool for deepening students’ mathematical understanding and engagement.
