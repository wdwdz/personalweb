Zhu, G., Zhu, W., Ratner, K., & Burrow, A. (Under review). Investigating Reciprocity between Daily Emotions and Learning Progress in Self-Directed Learning. Emotion. 

Control-value theory suggests the bidirectional association between learners' emotions
and academic performance, supported by empirical evidence. However, previous
studies are traditionally localized to the school context, and emotions are usually
measured across long intervals. What remains relatively unknown is whether the
results generalize to self-directed learning, where students' interest, control, and value
appraisals tend to play larger roles in the learning process and outcomes, as well as
what are the short-term dynamics between emotions and perceived learning progress.
This study addresses these gaps by examining intensive longitudinal data gathered
from 280 adolescents engaging in a ~10-week self-directed learning project using
dynamic structural equation modeling (DSEM). We found that negative emotions,
positive emotions, and perceived learning progress all demonstrated daily carryover
(i.e., inertia). Regarding the interplay between daily emotions and perceived learning progress, only changes in positive emotions had a positive predictive effect on next-
day changes in perceived learning progress. Adolescents who generally experienced greater positive emotions exhibited greater inertia in their daily perceived learning
progress and less inertia in negative emotions. These findings suggest the importance
of fostering students' positive emotions and helping them regulate the negative
emotion loop.
