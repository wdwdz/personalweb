abstract: This research paper introduced a survey instrument for evaluating learning environment satisfaction from home ambient environment experience and online learning environment experience. The survey questions examined a range of ambient environment factors together with scales extracted from online learning environment survey (OLLES)(Clayton, 2007) to systematically measure learning environment perception. The questionnaire was then tested in a field study. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses revealed a six-factor model of studentsâ€™ satisfaction with learning environment including ambient environment, student-student interaction, student-interface relationships, student-tutor relationships, student-content relationships, and student reflection activities. Structural equation modeling explained relationship among perception of ambient learning environment, perception of online learning environment and learning environment satisfaction. The development and field test of this survey tool enable evaluations of online learning environment within consideration of ambient environment, as well as support learning environment design and management.
